#Hello World, Again

It has been a long time since I wrote on here, and my career, interests, and technology stack have changed drastically.

When I started these posts, they were a combination of a place to get the things I was learning down in a place where I could refer back to them, and a bit of a resume booster.

That second consideration is no longer a serious concern. My resume is just fine. I don't really need a blog to help boost it, and I certainly wouldn't point to these old posts as any indication of my current practices.

What I want now is a place to write about whatever I'm intersted in writing about. Some of my writing will still be technical, but a lot of it will not be.



## Ch-ch-ch-changes

I guess this is a good place to give a little update on where I'm at these days.

I no longer do much with Ruby. I'll occasionally need to use it a little, but the vast majority of my work is in the Mulesoft integration stack, and particularly using the Mulesoft transformation language [Dataweave](https://docs.mulesoft.com/dataweave/2.4/dataweave-language-guide).

If I have to work with Java, which I do sometimes, I try to reach for Scala.

Otherwise, my preferred langauge is probably Elixir, though I don't consider myself proficient in it.

At this point, most of my work these days is designing and overseeing the implementation of integrations for clients. The client I am current working with I've been with full-time for over a year doing integrations between Enterprise systems like SAP, Salesforce, Kronos, and many others.

Let's see...non-technical stuff.

I'm no longer on Twitter or Facebook. I use Mastadon a little, but I generally avoid most social media.

I'm several years into a multi-year project to read a bunch of philosophy. I'll almost certainly write about that in the near future. I'm currently reading the Walter Kaufman translation of Nietzsche's 'The Gay Science'.
