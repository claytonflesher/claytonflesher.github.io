title: Hello World, Again
---

It has been a long time since I wrote on here, and my career, interests, and technology stack have changed drastically.

When I started these posts, they were a combination of a place to get the things I was learning down in a place where I could refer back to them, and a bit of a resume booster.

That second consideration is no longer a serious concern, and I certainly wouldn't point to these old posts as any indication of my current practices.

What I want now is a place to write about whatever I'm intersted in. Some of my writing may still be technical, but a lot of it will not be.

## Ch-ch-ch-changes

I guess this is a good place to give a little update on where I'm at these days.

I no longer do much with Ruby. In fact, I had to reinstall it on my laptop to update this blog. I occasionally need to use it a little, but the vast majority of my work is in the Mulesoft integration stack, and particularly using the Mulesoft transformation language [Dataweave](https://docs.mulesoft.com/dataweave/2.4/dataweave-language-guide).

If I have to work with Java, which I do sometimes, I try to reach for Scala.

Otherwise, my preferred langauge is probably Elixir, though I don't consider myself proficient in it. I can write a Phoenix application, and I understand the syntax well enough, but I'm not an expert with genserver, which is the real power tool in Elixir.

At this point, most of my work these days is designing and overseeing the implementation of integrations for clients. The client I am current at I've been with full-time for over a year doing integrations between enterprise systems like SAP, Salesforce, Kronos, and many others.

## Boring...

Let's see...non-technical stuff.

I'm no longer on Twitter or Facebook. I use Mastadon a little, but I generally avoid most social media.

I'm several years into a multi-year project to read a bunch of philosophy. I'll almost certainly write about that in the near future. I'm currently reading the Walter Kaufman translation of Nietzsche's 'The Gay Science'.

That seems as good of an update as any. I'm back. I'm going to write some more soon.
