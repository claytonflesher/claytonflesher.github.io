#The List

In my last post I talked about the list of 77 things I needed to know before I could call myself a Ruby developer, and where I'm at in my progress. This post is the actual list.

A caveat here. I did not write this list. It was written by my instructor, James Gray of [Gray Productions](graysoftinc.com) and [@JEG2 on Twitter](twitter.com/jeg2). 

James is a former member of the [Ruby Rogues Podcast](devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/), and you can get his take on a lot of these topics in detail there. Ruby Rogues is a great resource for any Ruby developer, at just about any level of experience. I'm slowly working my way through the back catalog.

I have his permission to share the list here. I take no responsibility for his liberal use of the Oxford comma, for which there is no excuse.
